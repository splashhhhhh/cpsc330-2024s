    "### 1.3 Sentence embedding representation\n",
    "\n",
    "_Points:_ 3\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen before, bag-of-words representation is limited in that it does not take into account word ordering and context. There are other richer and more expressive representations of text, and we are going to use one such representation in this homework. We will call it **sentence embedding representation**. We'll use [sentence transformer](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) to extract these representations. At this point it's enough to know that this is an alternative representation of text which usually works better than simple bag-of-words representation. We will talk a bit more about embedding representations in the coming weeks. To use sentence transformer, you need to install `sentence-transformers` in the course conda environment to run the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code below to create sentence embedding representation of documents in our toy corpus. \n",
    "2. Cluster the documents with this representation (`emb_sents`) and `KMeans` with the following arguments: \n",
    "    - `random_state=42` (for reproducibility)\n",
    "    - `n_clusters`=the number of clusters you identified in 1.1\n",
    "3. Store the labels as a list in `kmeans_emb_labels`"
